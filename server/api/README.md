# About the API folder

The API folder handles the requests and response interfacing between our server and the NewsAPI.org

* `request.py` contains all the requests a user might send
* `response.py` interprets all responses sent by NewsAPI.org

extensive documentation is also provided within the code, so give it a read and have fun :)
